{-| Commands for downloading files.

**SECURITY NOTE:** Browsers require that all downloads are initiated by a user
event. So rather than allowing malicious sites to put files on your computer
however they please, the user at least have to click a button first. As a
result, the following commands only work when they are triggered by some user
event.

# Download

-- DOWNLOAD


{-| Download a file from a URL. So you could download a GIF about math like
[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem#/media/File:Pythag_anim.gif)
or [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Mathematics/Featured_picture/2009_08#/media/File%3AVillarceau_circles.gif)
with the following code:

    import File.Download as Download

    saveMathGif : Cmd msg
    saveMathGif =
      Download.url "https://example.com/math.gif"

The downloaded file will use whatever name the server suggests.

**Note:** There exists a way to _suggest_ an alternate name, but it seems to
work only for same origin downloads. It should be more reliable to set the
[`Content-Disposition`][cd] header on the server side. Adding a header like
`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="triangle.gif"` should do it.

[cd]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition

url : String -> Cmd msg
url href =
  Task.perform never (Elm.Kernel.File.downloadUrl href)


{-| Download a `String` as a file. Maybe you markdown editor in the browser,
and you want to provide a button to download markdown files:

    import File.Download as Download

    save : String -> Cmd msg
    save markdown =
      Download.string "draft.md" "text/markdown" markdown

So the arguments are file name, MIME type, and then the file content. In this
case is is markdown, but it could be any string information.
-}
string : String -> String -> String -> Cmd msg
string name mime content =
  Task.perform never (Elm.Kernel.File.download name mime content)


{-| Download some `Bytes` as a file. Maybe you are creating custom images,
and you want a button to download them as PNG files. After using
[`elm/bytes`][bytes] to generate the file content, you can download it like
this:

    import Bytes exposing (Bytes)
    import File.Download as Download

    savePng : Bytes -> Cmd msg
    savePng bytes =
      Download.bytes "frog.png" "image/png" bytes

So the arguments are file name, MIME type, and then the file content. With the
ability to build any byte sequence you want with [`elm/bytes`][bytes], you can
create `.zip` files, `.jpg` files, or whatever else you might need!

[bytes]: /packages/elm/bytes/latest
